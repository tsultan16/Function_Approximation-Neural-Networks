# Implementation and testing of some simple neural network algorithms and deep learning models (from
the 'Deep Learning from scratch' textbpook by Seth Weidman):

The 'neural_network_mod' scipt is a self-contained python module containing classes that can be
used to build a neural deep learning/deep learning models and also contains a 'Trainer' class
which can be used to train datasets and compute predictions. 
(Activation functions: Sigmoid, Tanh)
(Loss functions: Mean-Squared, Softmax cross-entropy)
