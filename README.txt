# Implementation and testing of some simple neural network algorithms and deep learning models (adapted from
the 'Deep Learning From Scratch' textbook by Seth Weidman):

The 'neural_network_mod' scipt is a self-contained python module containing classes that can be
used to build a neural nwteork/deep learning models and also contains a 'Trainer' class which can
be used to train datasets and compute predictions. 

(Activation functions: Sigmoid, Tanh)
(Loss functions: Mean-Squared, Softmax cross-entropy)
